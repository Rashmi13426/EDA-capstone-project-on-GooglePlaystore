## Insights from EDA Visualizations

1. **Missing Values in Playstore Dataset**
   Bar chart visualizing the count of missing values in each column of the Playstore dataset to understand data quality issues.

2. **Missing Values in Reviews Dataset**
   Bar chart showing the number of missing values in each column of the Playstore reviews dataset to assess data completeness.

3. **Category-wise App Distribution**
   Bar chart showing the number of apps in each category, providing insights into the most and least populated app categories.

4. **App Type Distribution**
   Pie chart representing the proportion of Free vs Paid apps, giving an overview of the market segmentation.

5. **Histogram of App Ratings**
   Histogram displaying the distribution of app ratings across the dataset, identifying the most common rating levels.

6. **Histogram of App Sizes**
   Histogram showing the distribution of app sizes to analyze how size varies and spot outliers or trends.

7. **Histogram of Number of Reviews**
   Histogram showing the distribution of the number of reviews per app, highlighting the most reviewed vs less reviewed apps.

8. **Histogram of App Installs**
   Histogram showing the distribution of the number of installs, indicating the popularity of apps.

9. **Boxplot of Ratings by App Type**
   Boxplot comparing app ratings between Free and Paid apps to assess if there's a significant difference.

10. **Boxplot of App Size by Category**
    Boxplot depicting the distribution of app sizes across categories to highlight size variability.

11. **Boxplot of Number of Reviews by Category**
    Boxplot comparing the number of reviews across different app categories, indicating which categories attract more feedback.

12. **Boxplot of Installs by Category**
    Boxplot showing the distribution of app installs across categories to analyze popularity trends.

13. **Top 10 Categories by Number of Apps**
    Bar chart showing the top 10 app categories by the number of apps available, giving insight into market focus areas.

14. **Top 10 Apps by Installs**
    Bar chart highlighting the top 10 most installed apps, showcasing market leaders.

15. **Top 10 Apps by Ratings**
    Bar chart showing the top 10 highest-rated apps, pointing out the most highly-rated applications.

16. **Correlation Heatmap of Numeric Features**
    Heatmap visualizing correlations between numeric features such as Rating, Reviews, Size, and Installs, to uncover interdependencies.

17. **Scatter Plot: Reviews vs Rating**
    Scatter plot showing the relationship between number of reviews and ratings to investigate if highly reviewed apps have higher ratings.

18. **Scatter Plot: Size vs Installs**
    Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between app size and installs to explore whether size impacts popularity.

19. **Distribution of App Content Ratings**
    Bar chart showing the distribution of apps based on content rating (e.g., Everyone, Teen, Mature 17+), providing insight into app audience segmentation.

## Project Environment

This project was developed and executed in **Google Colab**.  
All notebooks, data analysis, and visualizations were created using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly within the Colab environment.
