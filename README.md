## Key Insights from EDA:

## Data Quality Checks:

Missing Values: Identified missing data in both apps and reviews datasets to ensure clean analysis.

## Outlier Detection: 
Addressed anomalies in installs, app sizes, and ratings for reliable insights.

## App Distribution:

Category-wise App Distribution: Games and Family dominate the Play Store, while niche categories like Medical and Maps & Navigation have fewer apps.

App Type Distribution: Majority of apps are Free, highlighting the freemium model dominance.

## Ratings & Reviews:

Rating Distribution: Most apps are clustered around 4–4.5 stars.

Reviews Analysis: Apps with high review counts don’t always have the highest ratings, indicating potential engagement-quality discrepancies.

## Popularity & Installs:

Top 10 Apps by Installs: Market leaders like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram dominate user adoption.

Installs by Category: Games and Communication apps have the highest average installs.

## App Characteristics:

Size vs Installs: Larger app size does not necessarily imply more installs.

Boxplots by Category: Certain categories like Photography show high size variability.

## Correlations & Relationships:

Correlation Heatmap: Ratings show weak correlation with installs, but reviews are moderately correlated with installs.

Scatter Analysis: Reviews vs Ratings reveal engagement patterns, while Size vs Installs indicates storage doesn’t strongly influence popularity.

## Audience Segmentation

Content Rating Distribution: Most apps target Everyone, followed by Teen, indicating family-friendly app dominance.

## Project Environment

This project was developed and executed in **Google Colab**.  
All notebooks, data analysis, and visualizations were created using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly within the Colab environment.
